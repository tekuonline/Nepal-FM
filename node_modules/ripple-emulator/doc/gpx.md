GPX is a platform-independent serialization schema that we have used to allow Ripple to simulate
geolocation routes.  There are several ways you can generate GPX files for use with Ripple, here 
are three examples:

1. Record an actual route using the Endomondo mobile app (http://endomondo.com).  After you have
    recorded the route, log into the Endomondo site and download the route as a GPX file using the
    export feature in the RH navigation pane.
2. Create a route by requesting driving directions at http://yournavigation.org.  Select the 'Export'
    feature and select GPX format
3. If you prefer Google maps, follow these instructions: http://www.elsewhere.org/journal/gmaptogpx/
